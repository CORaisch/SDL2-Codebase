#+TITLE: SDL2 Codebase
#+OPTIONS: tex:t
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This repo contains a few self-made SDL2 snippets, which deal as a lookup for bigger projects.

* TODOs
** extend event handler
*** add mouse events
** extend synthesizer
*** get rid of click sounds on key releases
**** add envelop to model attack, decay, sustain and release (the latter should cancle the clicky sounds)
*** model some nice instruments
** add crazy mode -> macro pixel noise + weird square sounds
