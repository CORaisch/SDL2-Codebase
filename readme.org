#+TITLE: SDL2 Codebase
#+OPTIONS: tex:t
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This repo contains a few self-made SDL2 snippets, which deal as a lookup for bigger projects.

* TODOs
** extend event handler
*** add mouse events
** extend synthesizer
*** add envelop to model attack, decay, sustain and release (the latter should cancle the clicky sounds)
**** envelop added but its bugged: when you are on one tone for quite a while the tone will become noisy after a while
***** it seems that the bug comes from the device buffer that will filled up after a while and then cannot recover since the callback loop takes too long
****** temporarily solved the bug by reducing the sample rate, in that way the device will demand for less data per second -> more time for the callback loop
****** TODO try to solve the bug using the SDL_PauseAudioDevice function to turn off the sound when no key is pressed.
*** model some nice instruments
