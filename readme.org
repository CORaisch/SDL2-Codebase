#+TITLE: SDL2 Codebase
#+OPTIONS: tex:t
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This repo contains a few self-made SDL2 snippets, which deal as a lookup for bigger projects.

* TODOs
** extend event handler
*** add mouse events
** extend synthesizer
*** add envelop to model attack, decay, sustain and release (the latter should cancle the clicky sounds)
**** envelop added but its bugged: when you are on one tone for quite a while the tone will become noisy after a while
*** investigate click sounds on key releases
*** model some nice instruments
